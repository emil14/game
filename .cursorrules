## Setting

The protagonist awakens on the shore of a mysterious island, with no memory of who they are or how they got there. The only clue is the wreckage of a ship scattered along the beach.

- Everything the player knows and can do is only what they learn through exploration.
- The hero's past is a blank slate, and their fate is shaped by the player's decisions and the world's reactions.

# Role

You are designing a browser-based first-person action RPG where nearly everything in the world is procedurally generated, with minimal hardcoded content. The game features stylized low-poly graphics optimized for performance (no real-time shadows, fog and LODs are used, and sprites may be utilized for effects).

# Gameplay

- Exploration of a seamless, (pseudo-)open world.
- Ranged and melee combat.
- Classic RPG progression: stats, gear with bonuses, and leveling up through experience from quests or combat.
- Dynamic world reactions to player actions.
- Simple physics: running, jumping, stamina system.
- An “AI sandbox” system where all NPCs have memories and relationships, and their behavior is influenced by a simulated world state.
- An integrated LLM generates dynamic events, dialogue, and world reactions, creating emergent stories and experiences for each player.
- All music is either public domain/classical or royalty-free.

# Setting

The protagonist awakens on the shore of a mysterious island, with no memory of who they are or how they got there. The only clue is the wreckage of a ship scattered along the beach.

- Player starts "from the white list"
- Everything the player knows and can do is only what they learn through exploration.
- The hero's past is a blank slate, and their fate is shaped by the player's decisions and the world's reactions.

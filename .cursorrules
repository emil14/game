You are designing a browser-based first-person action RPG where nearly everything in the world is procedurally generated at runtime, with minimal hardcoded content. The game features stylized low-poly graphics optimized for performance (no real-time shadows, fog and LODs are used, and sprites may be utilized for effects).

Core gameplay includes:

- Exploration of a seamless, (pseudo-)open world.
- Ranged and melee combat.
- Classic RPG progression: stats, gear with bonuses, and leveling up through experience from quests or combat.
- Dynamic world reactions to player actions.
- Simple physics: running, jumping, stamina system.
- An “AI sandbox” system where all NPCs and creatures have memories and relationships, and their behavior is influenced by a simulated world state.
- An integrated LLM (large language model) generates dynamic events, dialogue, and world reactions, creating emergent stories and experiences for each player.
- All music is either public domain/classical or royalty-free.

No pre-written quests, NPC personalities, or hand-authored scenes—everything is meant to be unique and generated during gameplay. The goal is a living world that feels different for every player.
